## 扯淡环节--我为什么要开发这样一个IDE

之前有dalao批判我说这个IDE根本没有存在的意义![](images/4.png)我先来讲讲我最近一件悲剧的事情:  
某一次模拟赛,老师~~突发奇想~~让我们到某一个计算机教室去考试,那里的电脑,只有Dev-C++,连MinGW都没有(别跟我说dev自带的那个tdmgcc,我试过在命令行里调用,各种花式报错)。没办法咯，只好凑合着用下。  
然后，在写某道题的时候发现崩溃了，于是就点击了调试（作为曾经被devcpp喂过屎的人，此时我的内心是忐忑的)，然后，意料之中的程序崩溃，以及意料之外的...devcpp也崩了。![](images/2.jpg)  
多次尝试之后发现，不能勾上“show CPU window”，否则就会崩，然后，我又发现，devcpp没告诉我程序崩在了哪！（代码编辑框里没有本该有的当前执行的代码位置，那个“CPU window”也看不了），  
![](images/3.jpg)   
我记得曾经有dalao说过“ide的调试不是只需要知道崩在哪了就行吗”,但这...可能不成吧![](images/5.jpg)    
于是后来搞了半天（主要是静态查错），终于想起windows下可能会栈溢出，找同学问了开栈指令之后发现....果然就不崩溃了![](images/4.png)（我平时都用ubuntu写代码，基本遇不上栈溢出，所以一直没有意识到）。于是就喜闻乐见的浪费了一些时间。  
ps. 有人可能会说“人傻怪IDE啊，我的Devcpp怎么没有问题？”这就是一个软件的适配问题了啊，没有任何一个软件敢保证自己能在每一台电脑上都完美工作，但好的软件自然应该尽可能的适配更多的环境，而devcpp呢？吐槽他的调试功能的大概不止我一个人吧![](images/5.jpg)    
这是我开发这个IDE的动机之一,给没有自己喜欢的ide的同学们多一个选择.![](images/5.jpg)  
所以，也不要拿vim等编辑器或者vs等ide来搞个大新闻把我批判一番说这IDE没有那些好用，如果你喜欢其他IDE/编辑器的话我也没有任何强迫的意思。![](images/5.jpg)  
  
ps.虽然我随时都可能弃坑，但是qtstudio还是会把qtcreator继续开发下去，所以（如果能有第一个release的话）基本不用担心停止更新的问题。![](images/5.jpg)
  
  


以下为Qt Creator的介绍：

# Qt Creator

Qt Creator is a cross-platform IDE for development with the Qt framework.

## Supported Platforms

The standalone binary packages support the following platforms:

* Windows 7 or later
* (K)Ubuntu Linux 16.04 (64-bit) or later
* macOS 10.8 or later

## Compiling Qt Creator

Prerequisites:

* Qt 5.6.0 or later
* Qt WebEngine module for QtWebEngine based help viewer
* On Windows:
    * ActiveState Active Perl
    * MinGW with g++ 4.9 or Visual Studio 2015 or later
    * jom
* On Mac OS X: latest Xcode
* On Linux: g++ 4.9 or later
* LLVM/Clang 3.9.0 or later (optional, needed for the Clang Code Model, see the
  section "Get LLVM/Clang for the Clang Code Model")
    * CMake (only for manual builds of LLVM/Clang)
* Qbs 1.7.x (optional, sources also contain Qbs itself)

The installed toolchains have to match the one Qt was compiled with.

You can build Qt Creator with

    # Optional, needed for the Clang Code Model:
    export LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/llvm (or "set" on Windows)
    # Optional, needed to let the QbsProjectManager plugin use system Qbs:
    export QBS_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/qbs

    cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY
    qmake -r
    make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)

Installation ("make install") is not needed. It is however possible, using

    make install INSTALL_ROOT=$INSTALL_DIRECTORY

## Compiling Qt and Qt Creator on Windows

This section provides step by step instructions for compiling the latest
versions of Qt and Qt Creator on Windows. Alternatively, to avoid having to
compile Qt yourself, you can use one of the versions of Qt shipped with the Qt
SDK (release builds of Qt using MinGW and Visual C++ 2015 or later).
For detailed information on the supported compilers, see
<https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git> .

   1.  Decide which compiler to use: MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio. If you
       plan to contribute to Qt Creator, you should compile your changes with
       both compilers.

   2.  Install Git for Windows from <https://git-for-windows.github.io/>. If you plan to
       use the MinGW compiler suite, do not choose to put git in the
       default path of Windows command prompts. For more information, see
       step 9.

   3.  Create a working directory under which to check out Qt and Qt Creator,
       for example, `c:\work`. If you plan to use MinGW and Microsoft Visual
       Studio simultaneously or mix different Qt versions, we recommend
       creating a directory structure which reflects that. For example:
       `C:\work\qt5.6.0-vs12, C:\work\qt5.6.0-mingw`.

   4.  Download and install Perl from <https://www.activestate.com/activeperl>
       and check that perl.exe is added to the path. Run `perl -v` to verify
       that the version displayed is 5.10 or later. Note that git ships
       an outdated version 5.8 which cannot be used for Qt.

   5.  In the working directory, check out the respective branch of Qt from
       <https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qt5.git> (we recommend the latest released version).

   6.  Check out Qt Creator (master branch or latest version, see
       <https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/qt-creator.git>).
       You should now have the directories qt and creator under your working
       directory.

   7.  Install a compiler:
       - For a MinGW toolchain for Qt, see <https://wiki.qt.io/MinGW> .

       - For Microsoft Visual C++, install the Windows SDK and the "Debugging
         Tools for Windows" from the SDK image. We strongly recommend using the
         64-bit version and 64-bit compilers on 64-bit systems.

         For the Visual C++ compilers, it is recommended to use the tool 'jom'.
         It is a replacement for nmake that utilizes all CPU cores and thus
         speeds up compilation significantly. Download it from
         <https://download.qt.io/official_releases/jom>
         and add the executable to the path.

   8.  For convenience, we recommend creating shell prompts with the correct
       environment. This can be done by creating a .bat-file
       (such as, `<working_directory>\qtvars.bat`) that contains the environment
       variable settings.
       A `.bat`-file for MinGW looks like:

         set PATH=<path_to_qt>\[qtbase\]bin;<path_to_mingw>\bin;<working_directory>\creator\bin;%PATH%
         set QMAKESPEC=win32-g++

       For the Visual C++ compilers, call the `.bat` file that sets up the
       environment for the compiler (provided by the Windows SDK or the
       compiler):

         CALL "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
         set PATH=<path_to_qt>\[qtbase\]bin;<working_directory>\creator\bin;%PATH%
         set QMAKESPEC=win32-msvc2013

       You can create desktop links to the `.bat` files using the working
       directory and specifying

        %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /E:ON /V:ON  /k <working_directory>\qtvars.bat

   9.  When using MinGW, open the shell prompt and enter:

        sh.exe

       That should result in a `sh is not recognized as internal or external
       command...` error. If a `sh.exe` is found, the compile process will fail.
       You have to remove it from the path.

   10. To make use of the Clang Code Model:

       * Install LLVM/Clang - see the section "Get LLVM/Clang for the Clang
         Code Model".
       * Set the environment variable LLVM_INSTALL_DIR to the LLVM/Clang
         installation directory.
       * When you launch Qt Creator, activate the Clang Code Model plugin as
         described in doc/src/editors/creator-clang-codemodel.qdoc.

   11. You are now ready to configure and build Qt and Qt Creator.
       Please see <https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git> for
       recommended configure-options for Qt 5.
       To use MinGW, open the the shell prompt and enter:

         cd <path_to_qt>
         configure <configure_options> && mingw32-make -s
         cd ..\creator
         qmake && mingw32-make -s

       To use the Visual C++ compilers, enter:

         cd <path_to_qt>
         configure <configure_options> && jom
         cd ..\creator
         qmake && jom

   12. To launch Qt Creator, enter:
       qtcreator

   13. To test the Clang-based code model, verify that backend process
         bin\clangbackend.exe
       launches (displaying its usage).

       The library libclang.dll needs to be copied to the bin directory if
       Clang cannot be found in the path.

   14. When using  Visual C++ with the "Debugging Tools for Windows" installed,
       the extension library `qtcreatorcdbext.dll` to be loaded into the
       Windows console debugger (`cdb.exe`) should have been built under
       `lib\qtcreatorcdbext32` or `lib\qtcreatorcdbext64`.
       When using a 32 bit-build of Qt Creator with the 64 bit version of the
       "Debugging Tools for Windows" the library should also be built with
       a 64 bit compiler (rebuild `src\libs\qtcreatorcdbext` using a 64 bit
       compiler).

       If you are building 32 bit and running on a 64 bit
       Windows, you can obtain the 64 bit versions of the extension library
       and the binary `win64interrupt.exe`, which is required for
       debugging from the repository
       <https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-creator/binary-artifacts.git/tree> .

   15. Qt Creator can be registered as a post-mortem debugger. This
       can be done in the options page or by running the tool qtcdebugger
       with administrative privileges passing the command line options
       -register/unregister, respectively. Alternatively,
       the required registry entries

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug

       can be modified using the registry editor regedt32 to contain

        <path>\qt-creator\bin\qtcdebugger %ld %ld

       When using a self-built version of Qt Creator as post-mortem debugger, it needs to be
       able to find all dependent Qt-libraries and plugins when being launched by the
       system. The easiest way to provide them for Qt 5 is to run the tool windeployqt:

        windeployqt -quick -qmldir share\qtcreator\welcomescreen -qmldir src\plugins\qmlprofiler bin\qtcreator.exe lib\qtcreator lib\qtcreator\plugins

Note that unlike on Unix, you cannot overwrite executables that are running.
Thus, if you want to work on Qt Creator using Qt Creator, you need a
separate build of it. We recommend using a separate, release-built version
of Qt and Qt Creator to work on a debug-built version of Qt and Qt Creator
or using shadow builds.

## Get LLVM/Clang for the Clang Code Model

The Clang Code Model depends on the LLVM/Clang libraries. The currently
supported LLVM/Clang version is 3.9.

### Prebuilt LLVM/Clang packages

Prebuilt packages of LLVM/Clang can be downloaded from

    https://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/libclang/

This should be your preferred option because you will use the version that is
shipped together with Qt Creator. In addition, the packages for Windows are
faster due to profile-guided optimization. If the prebuilt packages do not
match your configuration, you need to build LLVM/Clang manually.

If you use GCC 5 or higher on Linux, please do not use our LLVM package, but get
the package for your distribution. Our LLVM package is compiled with GCC 4, so
you get linking errors, because GCC 5 is using a C++ 11 conforming string
implementation, which is not used by GCC 4. To sum it up, do not mix GCC 5 and
GCC 4 binaries. On Ubuntu, you can download the package from
http://apt.llvm.org/ with:

   wget -O - http://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://apt.llvm.org/`lsb_release -cs`/ llvm-toolchain-`lsb_release -cs`-3.9 main"
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install llvm-3.9 libclang-3.9-dev

There is a workaround to set _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI to 1 or 0, but we recommend
to download the package from http://apt.llvm.org/.

   https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html

### Building LLVM/Clang manually

You need to install CMake in order to build LLVM/Clang.

Build LLVM/Clang by roughly following the instructions at
http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#git-mirror:

   1. Clone LLVM and switch to a suitable branch

          git clone http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git
          cd llvm
          git checkout release_39

   2. Clone Clang into llvm/tools/clang and switch to a suitable branch

          cd tools
          git clone http://llvm.org/git/clang.git
          cd clang
          git checkout release_39

   3. Build and install LLVM/Clang

          cd ../../..
          mkdir build
          cd build

      For Linux/macOS:

          cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation location> -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON ../llvm
          make install

      For Windows:

          cmake -G "NMake Makefiles JOM" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation location> -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON ..\llvm
          jom install
